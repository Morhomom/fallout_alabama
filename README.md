# Fallout Alabama

This project contains a small web application themed around the **Fallout Adventures of Alabama** series.  It consists of static pages located in `frontend/` and a few Node based API endpoints used to manage player data.

## Running the API locally

The API files under `api/` are written as serverless functions.  The easiest way to run them is with the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).  After installing it you can start a local development server:

```bash
npm install     # installs any dependencies
npx vercel dev  # serves the frontend and API
```

Opening the development address in your browser will load the pages from `frontend/` and requests to `/api/*` will invoke the functions from `api/` or `backend/` as configured in `vercel.json`.

## Running tests

The repository contains a small test suite for the character API.  Execute it with:

```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment

Deployment is done through Vercel.  Running `npx vercel` (and following the prompts) will upload the code and configure the rewrites defined in `vercel.json`.  Once deployed the static files and serverless functions will be served from the generated URL.

## Continuous Deployment

To automate deployments you can link this repository to Vercel. From the Vercel
dashboard choose **Add New&hellip;** â†’ **Project**, import the GitHub repository
and complete the setup. Once connected, every merge to the main branch will
trigger a new deployment automatically. With the GitHub integration enabled you
no longer need to run `npx vercel` manually.
